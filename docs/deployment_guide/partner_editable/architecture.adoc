As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* Amazon API Gateway for ConnectSense devices to self-provision.
* AWS Lambda: one function to provision devices and one to generate alerts to send to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. The Lambda functions require AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles created by the Quick Start.
* An Amazon SNS topic for publishing alerts.
* AWS IoT Core to publish the device metrics.
* AWS IoT Analytics to provide a pipeline, channel, data store, and dataset for processing the device metrics.
* Amazon QuickSight to provide a dashboard for data visualization.
* AWS SageMaker for a machine learning model.
* AWS IoT SiteWise for an asset model.
